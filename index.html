            <p> Hello there, I'm a fellow by the name of DKchonkykong or you might know me as BANG on Discord. I'm a university undergrad currently studing games for programming. My hobbies are: photography, writing (car lore or otherwise) and 3D modeling cars
              to name a few. Main languages I use for programming is C#, Python, etc.
            </p>
                Before I decided to study game dev, I played clarinet and piano for 8 years. I played mainly classical and jazz and was in two bands at one point. I haven't played for a few years due to being busy planing someday to play again. 
            </p>
            <p> Fun facts about me: I like reading manga and watching anime (played one of the One Piece opening theme songs while I was the clarinetist in the woodwind band), playing old racing games or JRPGs, I like retro tech as well and being a car enthusiast. I can aslo speak 4 Languages that being Spanish, English, Romanian and Catalan. 
            </p>
