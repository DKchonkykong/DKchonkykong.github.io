I'm a university undergrad currently studing games for programming. My hobbies are: photography, writing and 3D modeling cars
              to name a few. Main languages I use for programming is C#, Python, depends on what type of project I'm working on. 
            </p>
                Before I decided to study game dev, I played clarinet and piano for 8 years. I played mainly classical and jazz and was in two bands at one point. Although, I haven't played in a few years I do want to make music someday.
            </p>
