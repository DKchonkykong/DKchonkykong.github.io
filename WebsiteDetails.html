            <h5> This section is about how I made this site and other small tidbits about it.
            </h5>
          <p>
            How this whole thing started was due to me wanting to work on a smaller project while I was working on cars and other bits. So I figured making a website to catalogue all of the stuff I done be it hobbies or programming might help.
            The whole website is built with css and html theough githubpages and I got a template from petoKrisa on github but tweaked numerous things to fit something you'd see in a PlayStation portable/PS3 menu.
            I prefer this frutiger/skeumorphism aesthetic over the clean metro look partly due to nostalgia but also because I dislike the "metro" overtly clean look a lot of apps have gone through.

            <p> This is how it looked like vs now it took me awhile mainly due to me having to re-learn how to make websites again and being busy in general.
              I hope you like what I made here which took me a little over 2 weeks to do and I do plan in the future to have more stuff about games and programming perhaps on a different page.
